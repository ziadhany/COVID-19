## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between Confirmed , Active Case and 
New York  , New jersey , Louisiana  have the biggest Incidence Rate (cases per 100,000 persons.) in USA
California , New York , Texas  , Florida   have the biggest  number of people who have been tested . 
Mean test every report is about  (600000 test in California ) , (  500000 test in New York ) , ..
The Number of Confirmed and Recovered case in china increased dramatically in one day and then returned to original status . 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on just the confirmed , deaths  case 
I use the bar plots to know what is the the biggest  confirmed case in the USA state 
, box plot to konw the Testing rate distribution , and heatmap to know the unusual death in every country
